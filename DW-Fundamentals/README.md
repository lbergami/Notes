# Data Warehouse summary notes 


## Data Warehousing general concepts 

* DB and WH are not the same thing. A DW is written on top of a DB, so *usage* Vs *platform*.
  
* DW are useful for two reasons:
    * Data once transformed are available to support data-driven decisions.
    * One-stop shopping: data are integrating in one location
      
* There are a few rules to follow when we build a DW.


## Data Warehouse architecture 

1. Different approach between *centralized DW* Vs *component-based DW*: 


| centralized DW | component-based DW |
| -------- | ------- |
| Default option | Overcome org challenges but more complext to cross integrate different components |
| One-stop shopping: Single DW where all your data sources feed in  | It may create inconsistencies across data  |
| Lower data governace efforts | 
| More appropriate for Big Data |
