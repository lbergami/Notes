# Data Warehouse summary notes 

## Data Warehousing general concepts 

* DB and WH are not the same thing. A DW is written on top of a DB, so usage Vs platform.
* DW are useful for two reasons:
    * Data once transformed are available to support data-driven decisions.
    * One-stop shopping: data are integrating in one location
* There are a few rules to follow when we build a DW.
