# Data Warehouse summary notes 

## Data Warehousing general concepts 

* DB and WH are not the same thing. A DW is written on top of a DB, so *usage* Vs *platform*.
  
* DW are useful for two reasons:
    * Data once transformed are available to support data-driven decisions.
    * One-stop shopping: data are integrating in one location
      
* There are a few rules to follow when we build a DW.

## Data Warehouse architecture 

1. Different approach between *centralized DW* Vs *component-based DW*

| centralized DW                                        | component-based DW |
| --------                                                       | ------- |
| Default option - Single DW where all your data sources feed in 
  (one stop-shopping)               | $250 |
| February | $80 |
| March | $420 |
